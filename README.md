Code for my Intro to Robotics class

## Liability and Honor Code ##
I am NOT responsible for your grade or any Honor Code Violation. I only
place my code on GitHub so I can sync between computers and use version
control. This repository was kept private until final grades were submitted
to prevent violations and cheating, but was then publicized to display my coding
abilities for job interviews and related such. Use at your own risk. 

## Description
This class challenged me to design computer code for a [RSLK](https://university.ti.com/en/faculty/ti-robotics-system-learning-kit/ti-robotics-system-learning-kit) do do various tasks.

Videos and code of each task is in each folder's PDF Report. They also have been embedded here as a shortcut.

**Note that the labs are listed in reverse order so the more difficult labs are at the top.**
